# Missing-Person-Availability-Using-Deep-learning
AI-powered system to find missing persons using facial recognition. Utilizes deep learning (CNN), OpenCV, and Flask to match uploaded images with a database and identify individuals efficiently. Useful for police and NGOs in rescue missions.

üîç Finding Missing Person using AI ‚Äì GitHub Project Description
This project leverages artificial intelligence to assist in identifying and locating missing persons through facial recognition and deep learning. Built with Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras, it enables users to:

Upload or capture images of missing individuals

Match faces against a trained database using a deep learning model

Use computer vision techniques for real-time or batch processing

Generate alerts or reports upon positive identification

The goal is to support law enforcement agencies, NGOs, and humanitarian efforts in tracing missing individuals efficiently and accurately using AI-powered solutions.

Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Flask, Deep Learning, CNN
